     This is an example of an image tag.
     The SRC attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
     The src attribute can be an internet location(i.e, https:google.com/...)
     but the best practie is to have your own images folder that stores all 
     the images on your website
    
     NOTE: img is a self closing tag

     This is an example of an image tag.
     The SRC attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
     The src attribute can be an internet location(i.e, https:google.com/...)
     but the best practie is to have your own images folder that stores all 
     the images on your website
    
     NOTE: img is a self closing tag

     width="367x" 
     height="452x" 
     alt="A cloudy visual of pink heaven with libraries on either side and railings on top of the library shelves on both side 
     and the ceiling filled with paintings like the ones in a catholic church with people sing and dancing sitting on clouds. 
     A pink glowing cresent moon in the middle of the open door, the open door is curved at the top like a half circle with straight
     sides engulfed in clouds.
     Pink clouds fogging more than half the entire picture spewing out and inside the open door. 
     The color palette ranges from different types of pink,blue and white"

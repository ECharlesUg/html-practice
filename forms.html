    <h1>Afrobeat Suggestions</h1>
    <!--
            The form tag is used to create as container where al the inputs for a form must be put inside. The attributes that are
            required are name, id and method.

            name gives some descriptive information about what form will be used for.
            id allows us to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of out code.

            method has two typical values: get and post. Get is used for forms that do 
            not ask for personal information(search bars, etc). Post is used for forms
            that ask for personal info(login and signup pages etc)
            
        -->
    <form name="afrobeat-Suggestions" id="afrobeats" method="get" action="index.html">

        <!--
          This is a text input. type="text", name and id are all required attributes.
          The required attribute is only necessary when you want to make sure the user has to fill in the input befiore submitting 
          the form.

          The type attribute defines the type of input.
          The name attribute defines the variable name that would be used for the input when the data gets passed to the server
          (requires back-end scripting, which is beyond the scope of this course)
          The id attribute allows us to reference the input from the label and from other parts of our code.

          All inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the input using the input's id attribute.
          When an input is required, it is important to include the word required in the label's text

 <!--Each element that we create for a website NEEDS to go in the body of the document.
    
 Most elements start with opening tag and end with a closing tag.
 In this example, ,P. is the opening tag and </p> is the closing tag.
 Inside the opening and closing tags, is the content that you actually want to 
 display on the website.

 This is an example of a heading tag where it is the largest possible heading-->
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    
    <!--this is an example of a paragraph text-->
    <p>My name is Emmanuella Charles-Ugbechie</p>
    <br />
    <!-- this is an example of an a(anchor tag), which allows us to link to another web page-->

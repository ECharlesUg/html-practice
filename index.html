 <!--Each element that we create for a website NEEDS to go in the body of the document.
    
 Most elements start with opening tag and end with a closing tag.
 In this example, ,P. is the opening tag and </p> is the closing tag.
 Inside the opening and closing tags, is the content that you actually want to 
 display on the website.

 This is an example of a heading tag where it is the largest possible heading-->
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <!--this is an example of a paragraph text-->
    <p>My name is Emmanuella Charles-Ugbechie</p>
